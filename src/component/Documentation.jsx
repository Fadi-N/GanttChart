                The <strong>GanttChart</strong> component is a robust implementation of a Gantt-style chart, built with <code>react-chartjs-2</code> and <code>chart.js</code>.
                It offers an intuitive way for users to manage project timelines by adding, editing, deleting, filtering, and changing the status of events. This component is ideal for
                visualizing project phases and task progression, supporting streamlined project management.

                        Users can add new events using the <strong>Toolbar</strong> component, which includes form fields for creating a task with the necessary details. This enables project managers to document every task in a single view.

                        The <code>handleAddEvent</code> function validates the input fields, and upon successful validation, it adds the new event to the global <code>DataContext</code> state.
                        This function ensures that all new events contain complete information, maintaining the integrity of the data within the chart.

                        To modify an event, users can right-click on the event within the chart and select "Edit". This action opens a modal window, where users can adjust the taskâ€™s details such as the event name, start and end dates, and the description. This functionality is useful for real-time updates as project scopes change.

                        Right-clicking on an event provides an option to delete it. Selecting this action triggers the <code>handleDeleteEvent</code> function, which removes the specified event from the <code>DataContext</code>.
                        This feature helps keep the Gantt chart clean and relevant by allowing users to remove outdated or canceled tasks.
